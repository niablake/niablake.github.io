Week 2 me my mentor and partner countiuned on with the same process from the last week. We all continued evulating different articles and documenting them down in the google doc. I found a number of articles related to AI and covid-19. I read about how AI is being used to determine early symptons of Covid-19 in people, also i have read about how in certain countries they are already implementing this idea on their subway systesm, in an article i read, it can scan up to hundreds of people each minute to detect their body temperatures, etc to see if there are any symptoms of the virus. I also watched a few videos about the virus and technology just to gain a better understanding about how it works. I shared my ideas during our weekly bluejeans meeting and discussed key points. I received feeback that i was able to use to help assist me further along in the project. I also started using our shared google sheets to document important sites and to write a summary about each as well. This is used for us to see which articles will be able to help the most in our project.
