Week 4 me my mentor and partner worked on new subjects such as linux. I have never worked with linux before so this topic was very new to me. On my own time i went online watched videos and read the different commands that my graduate mentor had sent me. Doing this had helped me gain more knowledge on the topic linux and aslo helped me feel more comfortable discussing this particular topic. My partner was also kind enough to send me his github link for his previous course on linux to help me understand the subject more. Once i felt better about linux, i decided to go ahead and play around in the terminal by using the different commands to see what they do hands on. I did this for a while and was able to understand what each command was for. This week was a little challenging regarding me learning a new subject that everyone was already familair with but i was able to get through and learn the basics on my own.
