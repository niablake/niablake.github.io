title: Week 5
---

Week 5 i continued on from the previous week with my linux study, i was able to read more on this operating system as well as complete a few tutorial tasks to see how much i have learned the past week. I was able to help assist my group on our covid benchmarks that require linux knowledge. My mentor wanted me and my partner to be able to run and test different benchmarks within linux. I was able to get further than i did prior. I also looked a few covid research benchmarks examples that my mentor sent in the groupchat for me and my partner to go over. Doing this was a big help with gaining more knowledge on our topic and how to approach our topic.
