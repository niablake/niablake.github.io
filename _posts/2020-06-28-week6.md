title: Week 6

Week 6 i got started on creating my html homepage for my team to utilize throughout our project. Since i am more familiar with html, i was able to create and use this without much assistance. I started gathering summaries from articles that i thought were useful to our project as well as creating a template that would be very user friendly. Throughout this week i gathered my articles and placed them all in a folder to be used once i had my html homepage up and running. I started looking at examples of homepages and other blogs and came up with ideas that would help me with my page. I then shared these ideas with my mentor and group and they thought the ideas were good. I asked for feedback and recieved more ideas on what else i should add.
