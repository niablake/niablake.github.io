Week 7 i started completing my html homepage and gathering all of my ideas and articles to be posted. I used the tool "brackets" to develop the html code for the homepage that will be shared upon my group members. I had a little bit of error throughout but was able to easily overcome this and fix the issue. Once this was resolved i started placcing my summaries and findings into the html and creating tabs that can be accessed by the members. I will be adding more throughout that i believe will help us with our project. In the end i plan on making the homepage more of a accessible file if you will for our team members to always be able to find more information that will help them come up with their conclusions towards the project.
