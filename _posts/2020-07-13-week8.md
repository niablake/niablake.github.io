title: Week 8
---

Week 8 i continued with developing my html homepage for my partner and mentor to see. I added a few articles to the page and a few pictures. At first i did struggle with trying to create the page and having it the way everyone wanted it. I also, continued to look up significant articles related to our study and summarized key points as well as shared my findings amongst the others. This is pretty much all i did week 8.
