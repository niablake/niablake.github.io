Week 9 me and my partner paired to form our ideas and conclusion for our final presentation on our summer project. Me and my partner came together and used a shared google slide to post what we have been doing and what we have found throughout the summer. We also met over zoom the day before to helop us better understand what we both wanted to add to the slides. The next day we presented our powerpoint to the research group and had answered any ligering questions there may have been. Me and my partner both made sure that our presentation would come out the way we wanted by pracicing a few times before actually presenting.
