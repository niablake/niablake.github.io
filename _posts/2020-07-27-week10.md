title: Week 10
---

Week 10 was a wrap up week for me. I met with my mentor and partner one last time and explained what i have done the past week as well as what i have gained throughout this project. I believe this project has helped me become more independent is several ways. It has helped me with time management as well. The last week i pretty much continued doing what my mentor had asked of me, basically i contiuned looking for more relevant ideas pertaining to the project. It was the last week for me so i wrapped up all of my research and began on my final paper. The articles that i have found over the last 10 weeks have really helped me come up with conclusions especially for my final paper.
