Week 1, me my mentor discussed plans on how our research would go. We decided on a time to meet as well as decided what research path we wanted to take. We spoke over zoom and got to know each other a little better. My mentor was able to give me our graduate research mentor information so that i could stay in touch with her when i need additional help. Me and my mentor also talked about my plans for the future and how this research could help me prepare for graduate school. After we spoke and got to know each other better, my mentor gave me a schedule of what i should do over the next week or so. He sent my readings to read over to help me understand our project which will be mainly about gene genealogies and computational phylogenetics.
