Week 2 i continue to work on my readings that my mentor sent out to me. My mentor wants me to really read and undestand the research before we move on. I also got to meet with our graduate research student. We talked and got to know each other better, she made me feel more comfortable that i can also go to her for help as well, she also stated how we can both go through the readings together to gain a better understaning. This week was very interesting as i got to continue with the readings and was able to chat with the grad student. I believe it will take me a little more time to compelete the readings so that i know i have a good understanding of our project this summer.
