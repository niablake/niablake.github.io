title: Week 3
---

Week 3 i believe i will be able to complete all of my readings as well as take notes on what i have learned. I am excited to move on in our research and see whats new for us. Gene phylogenetics and gene genealogies is new for me but i am interested in computational biology as well so this should be fun for me. I got to speak with my mentor about our next steps so that i can prepare, the next steps for us is for me to start a few tutorials to get a hands on experience with our research, then we will move on to something even more involved. Each week i feel myself growing and learning as we move on, i am already learning with my readings that i have been assigned.
