---

Week 1 me my mentor and my partner all explored and gathered ideas for our summer project. We all brainstormed and shared ideas during our blue jeans meeting. I shared my idea about bio technology and how that can relate to times now and everyone agreed and decided to move foward with this subject. My mentor then shared some articles and videos about AI, covid-19 and bio technology for us to go ahead and read to gain a better understanding. Once this was done she than distrubuted parts to each of us for the week we than gathered all of out information for the week and posted our findings on our shared google doc. We of course than met via bluejeans to discuss our findings.
