## About Me

I am a junior attending Winston-Salem State University (WSSU), majoring in computer science. I have always enjoyed engaging in technology-related activities such as creating HTML webpages for a class or creating a java simulation program. I also enjoy learning about what technology does for society in the future. I first became interested in this field when I was in 8th grade. I had a computer-related course that completely grabbed my attention. My interest continued throughout high school, and I became absolutely sure I wanted to major in computer science when I attended college. I love the strategizing and problem solving that comes with computer science. In this field you are constantly looking for ways to improve the task. Being in college has increased my understanding of HTML, and allowed me to learn new material such as java, both of which are crucial in helping me to decide the exact path I want to take in the computer science field. Research, in addition to networking with the right people, has also been beneficial in guiding my career choice.
